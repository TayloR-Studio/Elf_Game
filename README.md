This code was written as an exercise for me to practise my python coding skills.
It is based on a game I played in secondary school maths - while the point of the game is meant to be to test basic arithmatic, I found automating it a useful coding exercise

The code itself can be found in the .ipynb file named 'Elf_game_code.ipynb'
The rules can be found in the txt document named 'Rules.txt'
